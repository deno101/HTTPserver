This is a siple java http server
it can be accessed by any browser and any custom http tool

by default it is hosted at localhost port 80
E.g of a url http://localhost/index.html

Index.html has to be at the root directory it dependancy cam be stored at the same location or a sub directory N.B remember to link the correctly

E.g of a css link <link rel='stylesheet' href='/static/style.css'> note the / before static

The program still shows debug info at the terminal

N.B the main class is at org.denniz.server.MainServer.class
